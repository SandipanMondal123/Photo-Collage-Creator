# Photo-Collage-Creator
This program is exactly what it sounds: a collage creator! We use an image provided by any source and manipulate it in a way such that the user wants. For example, if the user wants to augment the color or the view configuration, this program does that. 


This program uses Java and the main objective of the program is to advocate efficent code and use of data structures. Also, it is to note that this is a program from Data Strucutres I wrote for an assignment (Rutgers). 

I hope you like the program and if you have any extra ideas you'd like to see added, please free to contact me. I'd love a challenge!

Till then,

Thank You for viewing this repository
